Don't lose track of your payroll: sniff every cent that passes through your organization.

## **ABOUT THE PROJECT**

Track like a hound! This web app will help you analyze your payroll and number of employees. In the console, you'll learn about the quality of your organization's salaries. Additionally, we added a lottery feature to reward your employees.

Add your organization's employees without limits and in different rows.
